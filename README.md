# Code and Data for _"A flaw in using pre-trained pLLMs in protein-protein interaction inference models"_

## How To Use this Repository

Please consult the [documentation](https://Emad-COMBINE-lab.github.io/pllm-ppi-data-leakage/
) for information on how to install dependencies, run experiments, and generate all figures in the manuscript.

## Where's the Data?

There are 16GiB of compressed data which is too large for Git to reasonably handle. Data files can be downloaded via the BitTorrent protocol. More information is available in the [data](data/README.md) folder.

## Requirements and Dependencies

Instructions for installation, as well as details on requirements and dependencies, are all available through the [online documentation](https://Emad-COMBINE-lab.github.io/pllm-ppi-data-leakage/).

Python 3 is required to locally building the online documentation site. Package dependencies is available in the `requirements.txt` file in this folder. All code was tested on Linux (Debian-based Distrubtions).
