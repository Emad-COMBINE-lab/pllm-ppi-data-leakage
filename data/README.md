I can't include the data files in the Git repo, so I've uploaded them to the Internet Archive and Academic Torrents.

You can download from there and extract the contents here. To extract the file, you can use this command:

```
tar -I zstd -xvf data.tar.zst
```

If you can't use `tar` on your platform, you can maybe use [PeaZip](https://peazip.github.io/index.html).
